# Style guide
Consistent 2 space indentation
Always close braces on their own line
Use trailing commas
Good naming (long names preferred over short non-meaningful ones) of variables and functions
Add comments, preferably on docstrings
  Use template provided by /**   (vs Code)
    Example:
    /**
    * Opens a connection to the database
    * @param {number} num amount of whatever
    * @param {string} adsf username
    */
